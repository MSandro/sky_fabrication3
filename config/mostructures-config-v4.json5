  //Welcome to Mo'Structures Config!
  //
  //This config used to allow you to modify our mod's structures.
  //However, Mojang changed the way structures were done.
  //Now, most of our structures are fully in code.
  //
  //The purpose of this config file is to lead users to find
  //the necessary resources needed to modify our structures.
  //
  //And, this is a good change.
  //
  //Not only can you now modify the generation of a structure, but you will also get
  //to modify the biomes they spawn in and as much other stuff.
  //
  //All you need to know is that you will have to find
  //how to make structure datapacks and use that knowledge
  //to modify Mo' Structures.
  //
  //To modify the chance of a structure spawning, you will have to work with
  //datapack structure_sets.
  //
  //To modify biomes, you will only have to use tags, a convenient way to modify the mod.
  //
  //To modify the structures to avoid collision to, you will also have to work with structure_sets.
  //
  //To modify the height range the terrain around the structures may be, you will also have to work iwth structure_sets.
  //
  //Go to Frqnny's Discord for questions; link is in the curseforge page.

  //Below is a lilboolean, do whatever you want with him.
